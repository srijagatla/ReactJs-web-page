        <p>React is an efficient, flexible, and open-source JavaScript framework library that allows developers to the creation of simple, fast, and scalable web applications. Jordan Walke, a software engineer who was working for Facebook created React. It was first deployed on the news feed of Facebook in 2011 and on Instagram in 2012. Developers from the Javascript background can easily develop web applications with the help of React.</p>
        <p><b>Scope of React: </b>The selection of the right technology for application or web development is becoming more challenging. React has been considered to be the fastest-growing Javascript framework among all. The tools of Javascript are firming their roots slowly and steadily in the marketplace and the React certification demand is exponentially increasing. React is a clear win for front-end developers as it has a quick learning curve, clean abstraction, and reusable components. Currently, there is no end in sight for React as it keeps evolving.</p>

        <p>MVC is generally abbreviated as Model View Controller.</p>
        <ul>
          <li>
            <b>Use of Virtual DOM to improve efficiency: </b> React uses virtual DOM to render the view. As the name suggests, virtual DOM is a virtual representation of the real DOM. Each time the data changes in a react app, a new virtual DOM gets created. Creating a virtual DOM is much faster than rendering the UI inside the browser. Therefore, with the use of virtual DOM, the efficiency of the app improves.
          </li>
          <li><b>Gentle learning curve: </b>React has a gentle learning curve when compared to frameworks like Angular. Anyone with little knowledge of javascript can start building web applications using React.</li>
          <li><b>SEO friendly: </b>React allows developers to develop engaging user interfaces that can be easily navigated in various search engines. It also allows server-side rendering, which boosts the SEO of an app.</li>
          <li><b>Reusable components: </b>React uses component-based architecture for developing applications. Components are independent and reusable bits of code. These components can be shared across various applications having similar functionality. The re-use of components increases the pace of development.</li>
          <li><b>Huge ecosystem of libraries to choose from: </b>React provides you with the freedom to choose the tools, libraries, and architecture for developing an application based on your requirement.</li>

        <header><h2 class="heading">Limitations of React</h2></header>
        <p>The few limitations of React are as given below:</p>
        <li>React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.</li>
        <li>React is not a full-blown framework as it is only a library.</li>
        <li>It might be difficult for beginner programmers to understand React.</li>
        <li>Coding might become complex as it will make use of inline templating and JSX.</li></br>

      <section class="main-section" id="React_ES6">
        <header><h2 class="heading">React ES6</h2></header>
        <p>ES6 stands for ECMAScript 6.</p>

         <p>ECMAScript was created to standardize JavaScript, and ES6 is the 6th version of ECMAScript, it was published in 2015, and is also known as ECMAScript 2015.</p>
         <p>React uses ES6, and you should be familiar with some of the new features like:</p>

        <li>Classes</li>
        <li>Arrow Functions</li>
        <li>Variables (let, const, var)</li>
        <li>Array Methods like .map()</li>
         <li>Destructuring</li>
         <li>Modules</li>
         <li>Ternary Operator</li>
         <li>Spread Operator</li>

      <section class="main-section" id="React_JSX">
        <header><h2 class="heading">React JSX</h2></header>
        <p>JSX is a syntax extension of JavaScript. It is used with React to describe what the user interface should look like. By using JSX, we can write HTML structures in the same file that contains JavaScript code.</p>
        <p><b>Coding JSX :</b></p>
        <code>
const myElement = I Love JSX!;
const root = ReactDOM.createRoot(document.getElementById('root'));
root.render(myElement);
        </code></br>
        <li>JSX allows us to write HTML elements in JavaScript and place them in the DOM without any createElement()  and/or appendChild() methods.</li>

        <li>JSX converts HTML tags into react elements.</li>

         <p>You are not required to use JSX, but JSX makes it easier to write React applications.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="React_Class_Components">
        <header><h2 class="heading">React Class Components</h2></header>
        <p>Before React 16.8, Class components were the only way to track state and lifecycle on a React component. Function components were considered "state-less".</p>

       <p>With the addition of Hooks, Function components are now almost equivalent to Class components. The differences are so minor that you will probably never need to use a Class component in React.</p>

      <p>Even though Function components are preferred, there are no current plans on removing Class components from React.</p>

      <p>This section will give you an overview of how to use Class components in React.</p>
      <p><b>Create a Class Component</b></p>
      <code>
class Car extends React.Component {
render() {
  return (h2)Hi, I am a Car!(/h2));
  }
}
      </code>
      <p>When creating a React component, the component's name must start with an upper case letter.</p>

      <p>The component has to include the <b>extends React.Component</b> statement, this statement creates an inheritance to React.Component, and gives your component access to React.Component's functions.</p>

      <p>The component also requires a <b>render()</b> method, this method returns HTML.</p>

      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="React_Props">
        <header><h2 class="heading">React Props</h2>
        <p></header>
          Props are arguments passed into React components.Props are passed to components via HTML attributes.props stands for properties.
        </p>
        <code>
const myElement = (h2)Car brand="Ford"(/h2);
        </code></br>
        <li>React Props are like function arguments in JavaScript and attributes in HTML.</li>

        <li>To send props into a component, use the same syntax as HTML attributes:</li>
        <p><b>Add a "brand" attribute to the Car element:</b></br>const myElement = (Car brand="Ford" );</p>
        <p>Props are also how you pass data from one component to another, as parameters.</p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="React_hooks">
        <header><h2>React hooks</h2></header>
        <p>Hooks were added to React in version 16.8.</p>

        <p>Hooks allow function components to have access to state and other React features. Because of this, class components are generally no longer needed.</p>

         <p>Although Hooks generally replace class components, there are no plans to remove classes from React.</p>
         <p>Hooks allow us to "hook" into React features such as state and lifecycle methods.</p>
         <li>You must import Hooks from react.</li>

          <li>Here we are using the useState Hook to keep track of the application state.</li>

           <li>State generally refers to application data or properties that need to be tracked.</li>
           <code>
             ...
import React, { useState } from "react";
import ReactDOM from "react-dom/client";

function FavoriteColor() {
   const [color, setColor] = useState("red");
}
...

           </code></br>

         <p><b>Hook Rules</b></p>
         <p>There are 3 rules for hooks:</p>

       <li>Hooks can only be called inside React function components.</li>
        <li>Hooks can only be called at the top level of a component.
Hooks cannot be conditional</li>
  <li> Note: Hooks will not work in React class components.</li>

      <p><b>Custom Hooks</b></p>
       <p>If you have stateful logic that needs to be reused in several components, you can build your own custom Hooks.</p>
     </section>
     <section class="main-section" id="useState()_in_React">
       <header><h2>useState() in React</h2></header>
       <p>The useState() is a built-in React Hook that allows you for having state variables in functional components. It should be used when the DOM has something that is dynamically manipulating/controlling.</p>
       <code>
         ...
const [count, setCounter] = useState(0);
const [otherStuffs, setOtherStuffs] = useState(...);
...
const setCount = () => {
   setCounter(count + 1);
   setOtherStuffs(...);
   ...
};
       </code></br>
       <p><b>Example of useState(): </b> </p>
       <li>To use the useState Hook, we first need to import it into our component.</li>
       <li>We initialize our state by calling useState in our function component.</li>

<li>useState accepts an initial state and returns two values:<li>

<li>The current state.</li>
<li>A function that updates the state</li></br>

        <ul>
          <li>React is an efficient, flexible JavaScript library for building user interfaces.
</li>
<li>New features introduced in JavaScript as a part of ES6 are let, const, arrow functions, 
promise, and class.</li>
<li>The main benefits of using JSX are that you can leverage the full power of JavaScript in 
HTML and avoid learning or using a templating language. It allows React to show useful 
errors and warning messages</li>
<li>The four types of React components are Functional, Class, Pure, and High-order components.</li>
<li>Functional components are most useful when the lifecycle of the component does not have to 
be managed.</li>
<li>Class components are more versatile.
</li>

              <h3>2. React Components</h3>
              <ul>
              <li>State is a plain JavaScript object used by React to represent information about the component’s current situation<li>
              <li>Props is a shortened form for properties, and they are used to pass data between React components in a unidirectional flow from parent to child.</li>
               <li>You can pass data between components from parent to child using properties, from child to parent using callbacks, and between siblings.</li>
               <li>Components are created or mounted on the DOM; they grow by updating and then die or are unmounted on DOM. This is referred to as a component lifecycle.</li>
           <li>React components can be tested using Mocha, Chai, and Sinon, but preferred approaches are using Jest and React Testing Library.</li>
           </ul>

           <h3>3. Advanced React</h3>
           <ul>
            <li>Hooks provide a way to use functionalities such as context or state without classes.</li>
            <li>Inputs in React can be one of two types: controlled or uncontrolled.</li>
             <li>Redux is a state management library often used with React to handle the state of your application.</li>
            <li>The Redux elements involved in updating the component properties are action, store, and reducer. </li>
            <li>You can interact with asynchronous data in your React Redux app using middleware.</li>
             <li>The data flow in the React-Redux application is unidirectional</li>
